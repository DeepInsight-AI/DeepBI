object with two fields:\n\n    {\n      showModal: (dialogProps) => object({\n          close: (result) => void,\n          dismiss: (reason) => void,\n          onClose: (handler) => this,\n          onDismiss: (handler) => this,\n        }),\n      Component: React.Component, // wrapped dialog component\n    }\n\n  To open dialog, use `showModal` method; optionally you can pass additional properties that\n  will be expanded on wrapped component:\n\n    const dialog = SomeWrappedDialog.showModal()\n\n    const dialog = SomeWrappedDialog.showModal({ greeting: 'Hello' })\n\n  To get result of modal, use `onClose`/`onDismiss` setters:\n\n    dialog\n      .onClose(result => { ... }) // pressed OK button or used `close` method\n      .onDismiss(result => { ... }) // pressed Cancel button or used `dismiss` method\n\n  If `onClose`/`onDismiss` returns a promise - dialog wrapper will stop handling further close/dismiss\n  requests and will show loader on a corresponding button until that promise is fulfilled (either resolved or\n  rejected). If that promise will be rejected - dialog close/dismiss will be abandoned. Use promise returned\n  from `close`/`dismiss` methods to handle errors (if needed).\n\n  Also, dialog has `close` and `dismiss` methods that allows to close dialog by caller. Passed arguments\n  will be passed to a corresponding handler. Both methods will return the promise returned from `onClose` and\n `onDismiss` callbacks. `update` method allows to pass new properties to dialog.\n\n\n  Creating a dialog\n  ================\n\n  1. Add imports:\n\n    import { wrap as wrapDialog, DialogPropType } from 'path/to/DialogWrapper';\n\n  2. define a `dialog` property on your component:\n\n    propTypes = {\n      dialog: DialogPropType.isRequired,\n    };\n\n  `dialog` property is an object:\n\n    {\n      props: object, // properties for <Modal> component;\n      close: (result) => void, // method to confirm dialog; `result` will be returned to caller\n      dismiss: (reason) => void, // method to reject dialog; `reason` will be returned to caller\n    }\n\n  3. expand additional properties on <Modal> component:\n\n    render() {\n      const { dialog } = this.props;\n      return (\n        <Modal {...dialog.props}>\n      );\n    }\n\n  4. wrap your component and export it:\n\n    export default wrapDialog(YourComponent).\n\n  Your component is ready to use. Wrapper will manage <Modal>'s visibility and events.\n  If you want to override behavior of `onOk`/`onCancel` - don't forget to close dialog:\n\n    customOkHandler() {\n      this.saveData().then(() => {\n         this.props.dialog.close({ success: true }); // or dismiss();\n      });\n    }\n\n    render() {\n      const { dialog } = this.props;\n        return (\n          <Modal {...dialog.props} onOk={() => this.customOkHandler()}>\n        );\n    }\n*/\n\nexport const DialogPropType = PropTypes.shape({\n  props: PropTypes.shape({\n    visible: PropTypes.bool,\n    onOk:
